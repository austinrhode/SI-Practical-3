"""
Write a function that given a list of word,
will return a dictionary of the shortest word
that begins will each letter of the alphabet. 

For example, if the list is ["Hello", "hi", "Goodbye", "ant", "apple"]
your dictionary would be 
{
    h: "Hi",
    g: "Goodbye",
    a: "ant"
}
because those are the shortest words that start with h, g, and a (which are the only starting letters present)
Notice that the function is not case sensitive.
