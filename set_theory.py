"""
Takes in two sets and returns a new set that contains
all values that are in set1 that are not in set2.

For example,
The set difference of {1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 4} is {1},
becuase 1 is the only value in set1 that is not in set2.
On the other hand, the set difference of {2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3} is {4},
meaning that the result depends on which set is set1.
